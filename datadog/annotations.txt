By default dogstatsd will only listening to localhost, you need to add -e DD_DOGSTATSD_NON_LOCAL_TRAFFIC=true option to the container's parameters to listen to dogstatsd packets from other containers (required to send custom metrics).

If your Linux distribution does not include an /etc/os-release file, mount the equivalent one provided, for example /etc/redhat-release or /etc/fedora-release.
